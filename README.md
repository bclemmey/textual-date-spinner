# Textual Date Spinner

This is a simple widget for selecting a date in the Textual framework. It features 3 boxes for year, month and day,
and allows you to either type a date, or use the up and down arrows to increment and decrease the numbers, with 
automatically flipping of the day/month/year to keep things constrained on valid dates.
